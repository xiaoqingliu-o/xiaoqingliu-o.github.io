    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Welcome! I am currelty a postdoctoral research associate at Purdue University, working with <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~huberm/Climate_Dynamics_Prediction_Laboratory/CDPL.html" style="color: #3BB9FF">Prof. Matthew Huber</a>. I study past warm climates of the Earth using climate proxies and paleoclimate modeling. My research aims to understand how surface temperatures have responded to changes in atmospheric CO2 levels or other forcings throughout geologic history, by reconstructing sea surface temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels using organic proxies and combing them with paleoclimate modeling. In my most recent work, Iâ€™m focused on connecting the warming patterns of the paleo-ocean to our future.</p>
    <p>I earned my Ph.D in oceanography from Texas A&M University, advised by <a href="https://chemclimatology.org" style="color: #3BB9FF">Prof. Yige Zhang</a>. I obtained my M.S. in marine geology from Tongji University under the guidance of <a href="https://www.aminer.org/profile/jian-zhimin/542e00c2dabfae4b91c3b5b9" style="color: #3BB9FF">Prof. Zhimin Jian</a>. My B.S. degree was earned at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan).</p>
