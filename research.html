                   My research focuses on three primary themes: (1) reconstructing sea surface temperatures of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and using it to build a spatial pattern of high-latitude amplification, thus connecting paleo-ocean warming patterns to future climate change; (2) improving the reconstruction of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the geologic past by refining the alkenone-CO<sub>2</sub> method; and (3) simulating the early-to-middle Miocene warmth under reconstructed CO<sub>2</sub> levels to understand why climate models fail to reproduce past warm climates.

                <h2>High-latitude amplified warming relative to the WPWP and paleo-ocean warming pattern</h2>
                <p>The WPWP represents the warmest and largest surface water body, playing a crucial role in determining global energy budgets. Its thermal history is critical, since as defines the equator-to-pole gradients and high latitude amplification. However, the thermal evolution of the WPWP remains ambiguous due to questions surrounding the accuracy of the proxies used, the corrections applied, and the selection of study sites. I have presented new multi-proxy and multi-site SST records of the WPWP spanning the last 10 million years (Myr). These records, together with the published data, unequivocally show that the warm pool was much warmer in the Mio-Pliocene and cooled over the entire studied interval. We present a persistent high-latitude amplification in the Pacific Ocean over the past 10 million years (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35011-z" style="color: #0077b6">Liu et al., 2022, Nature Communications</a>).</p>
                <p>Building upon my previous study of Pacific high latitude amplification, which introduced a novel method of analyzing SST records by focusing on their spatial relationships rather than the traditional time-based approach, I have examined globally distributed SST reconstructions spanning the last 10 Myr. These data were used to establish an equilibrium ocean warming pattern, which was then directly compared to millennium-long climate simulations that reach equilibrium conditions in response to a quadrupling of CO2 levels. Surprisingly, certain leading climate models, such as NCAR's Community Earth System Model (CESM), exhibited striking similarities to the geological data, despite fundamental differences in data acquisition methods and timescales. This convergence of findings enhances our confidence in both the data and models for understanding Earth's past climate and predicting its future trajectory. This study titled "Connecting warming patterns of the paleo-ocean to our future" (Liu et al., AGU Advances, accepted) bridges the gap between paleoclimate data from Earth's distant past and the climate change of the Common Era presents a major challenge due to substantial differences in timescales and magnitudes of climate change.</p>

                <h2>Improving the reconstruction of ancient atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels</h2>
                <p>My research focuses on alkenone-based CO<sub>2</sub> method, which has been widely used to estimate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels over the Cenozoic. It is based on concept that the stable carbon isotopic fractionation during photosynthesis of marine algae is controlled by aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and the physiology parameter (‘b’).</p>
                <p>Constraining ‘b’ is key to the successful application of the alkenone-CO2 method. I have worked to better estimate ‘b’ by using a diffusive model and establishing a relationship between cell size and growth rate. Building on this refined approach, the reconstructed CO2 levels for the last three glacial-interglacial cycles are comparable to ice core data in both the amplitude of changes and absolute values (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2020.05.002" style="color: #0077b6">Zhang, Henderiks, and Liu, 2020, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta</a>).</p>
                <p>Despite the previous progress, the alkenone-CO2 method still faces challenges (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-082420-063026" style="color: #0077b6">Rae, Zhang, Liu et al., 2021, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences</a>). For instance, the current diffusive model does not account for the active transport of carbon by the alkenone-synthesizing haptophytes. We are still working on refining this approach. Stay tuned.</p>

                <h2>Simulating the early-to-middle Miocene warmth</h2>
                <p>The issue of climate models failing to capture high-latitude warmth and a low meridional temperature gradient when driven by reconstructed CO2 concentrations is evident in several past warm periods, including the Cretaceous, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and mid-Pliocene. My research focuses on the Miocene. During the early-to-middle Miocene (~23-13.8 million years ago), the global mean surface temperature was approximately 7-8°C warmer than preindustrial. This global mean warming was underestimated in previous Miocene simulations, particularly in the northern high latitudes, leading to an overestimation of the equator-to-pole temperature gradient. This indicates that processes key to high-latitude temperature changes are not well represented in climate models. </p>
                <p>I have explored two processes by conducting fully coupled paleoclimate simulations for the early-to-middle Miocene with CESM: (1) changes in northern high-latitude gateways, specifically, an open Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) gateway (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL109159" style="color: #0077b6">Liu et al., 2024, Geophysical Research Letters</a>), and (2) a major source of uncertainty in the simulation of climate changes—cloud processes, especially cloud phase partitioning important for Arctic mixed-phase clouds  (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL111831" style="color: #0077b6">Liu et al., 2025, Geophysical Research Letters</a>).</p>
