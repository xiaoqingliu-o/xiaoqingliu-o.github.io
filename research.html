                <p>
                   My research focuses on three primary themes: (1) reconstructing sea surface temperatures of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and using it to build a spatial pattern of high-latitude amplification, thus connecting paleo-ocean warming patterns to future climate change; (2) improving the reconstruction of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the geologic past by refining the alkenone-CO<sub>2</sub> method; and (3) simulating the early-to-middle Miocene warmth under reconstructed CO<sub>2</sub> levels to understand why climate models fail to reproduce past warm climates.

                    <h3>High-latitude amplified warming relative to the WPWP and paleo-ocean warming pattern</h3>
                    <p>The WPWP represents the warmest and largest surface water body, playing a crucial role in determining global energy budgets. Its thermal history is critical, since as defines the equator-to-pole gradients and high latitude amplification. However, the thermal evolution of the WPWP remains ambiguous due to questions surrounding the accuracy of the proxies used, the corrections applied, and the selection of study sites. I have presented new multi-proxy and multi-site SST records of the WPWP spanning the last 10 million years (Myr). These records, together with the published data, unequivocally show that the warm pool was much warmer in the Mio-Pliocene and cooled over the entire studied interval (Liu et al., 2022, Nature Communications).</p>

                    <h3>Improving the reconstruction of ancient atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels</h3>
                    <p>My research focuses on alkenone-based CO<sub>2</sub> method, which has been widely used to estimate atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels over the Cenozoic. It is based on concept that the stable carbon isotopic fractionation during photosynthesis of marine algae is controlled by aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and the physiology parameter (‘b’).</p>

                    <h3>Simulating the early-to-middle Miocene warmth</h3>
                    <p>The issue of climate models failing to capture high-latitude warmth and a low meridional temperature gradient when driven by reconstructed CO2 concentrations is evident in several past warm periods, including the Cretaceous, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and mid-Pliocene. My research focuses on the Miocene. During the early-to-middle Miocene (~23-13.8 million years ago), the global mean surface temperature was approximately 7-8°C warmer than preindustrial. This global mean warming was underestimated in previous Miocene simulations, particularly in the northern high latitudes, leading to an overestimation of the equator-to-pole temperature gradient. This indicates that processes key to high-latitude temperature changes are not well represented in climate models. </p>
